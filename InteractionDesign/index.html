                        The complexity of the interface's input — a descriptive text string — does not match the richness of the model's output — a huge range of visual output ranging over content and style. Output does not reflect the user's intent.

                        Faced with this mismatch of intended image to possible output, people improvise. Their prompts get longer and more complicated. People look for secret key words and prompt hacks to bend the output towards their imagination. They randomly generate image after image in an attempt to find the lucky mix of parameters to realize the image they have in their head.                    </p>

            <p class="text">
                Diffusion shows us that machines now exhibit their own creative process. They don’t just record human intent for how pixels should be. They generate their own work. This calls for a new paradigm of human computer interaction.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                People can now work with a computer in the same way that an art director would work with a talented illustrator. In an interaction language which is fundamentally iconic (visual) and symbolic (linguistic.)            </p>
            <p class="text">
                We’re entering the era of computer as creative visual partner.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                All partnerships rest on how good the communication is.

                We propose the right medium is a medium of visual dialog.

                        Human intelligence freely operates at different levels of abstractions. People zoom in and out of scope. They switch contexts and synthesize new combinations.

                    <p class="text">
                        Machine Intelligence rests on complicated mathematical representations of images and text. Style, theme and content are manifested through a complex set of mathematical operations.

                        A meaningful conversation between these two beings needs to create a bridge to connect the disparate strengths and abilities of the two parties.

                        For things like color, size, and shape, we don’t need to know how those are encoded in latent space. We need a set of operations which allows us to express those properties.
